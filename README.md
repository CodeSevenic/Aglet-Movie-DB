# Aglet Movie DB (Created as a Challenge) by Sibusiso

I Created this project (Aglet Movie DB) as a challenge to join the team at Aglet
IT Company.

Tech Stack:

So, I chose to build the project using ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS and MongoDB. I
could've used Vanilla JS however, ReactJS makes the entire development process
easier, manageable and enjoyable.

Setting up the project:

1. Download the zip file and extract it.
2. Inside the main folder: -> npm install
3. Then: -> cd client -> npm install
4. back to main folder -> npm start
5. Then: -> cd client -> npm start
